# What is BuhoCMS?

BuhoCMS is a **local Content Management System** for **static site generators** like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (support for others is planned for the future). 

See BuhoCMS as a **GUI for static site generators**. Easily **create or open a website**, **choose your theme** and **add your first posts**. With BuhoCMS, adding and editing content is as easy as a few clicks. No more terminal commands, folder hunting or manual Front matter edits ðŸ¥³

### Who is BuhoCMS for?

BuhoCMS is made for... you ðŸ˜ƒ

...that is, everyone using Hugo or Jekyll as a static site generator who wants an **easy to use**, **graphical way** to **edit content**, so that you can make the best use out of the power of a static site generator: *Creating and editing content.*

BuhoCMS is for you if you land in at least one of the following categories:

- You **already have a Hugo or Jekyll site** and want to easily edit your content from now on
- You want to **create a new Hugo or Jekyll site from zero** with a graphical user interface
- You are a **beginner** looking for a **simple way to begin your journey** in using static site generators

## :warning: Alpha warning
BuhoCMS is currently in Alpha. While most things should work as expected, bugs :bug: are likely to exist. It is a good idea to backup ðŸ’¾ your website folders just in case. Also, remember that [many more features](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms#roadmap) are planned! :sparkles:

### macOS

macOS support is planned. Unfortunately I do not currently own a macOS device; to build and test BuhoCMS, a macOS device is needed. 

### Linux

Supported | Planned
|-|-|
| Flatpak (Flathub) | Snap |
| AppImage | AUR |
| .deb | .rpm |

<br>

To install BuhoCMS as a **Flatpak**, head over to Flathub. In order to run executable commands on your host system, you need to give the following permission in your Terminal: `flatpak --user override org.buhocms.BuhoCMS --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak`

For better desktop integration consider using [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

# Contributing

These are the ways you can contribute to BuhoCMS:

### Translating

Languages currently supported: 
  - English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
  - German (Deutsch) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
  - Chinese (ä¸­æ–‡) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³

**First steps:**
1. If not already supported (see above), request a new language by [opening an issue](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/issues) on GitHub and I will add the necessary code for the second step.
2. Translate an already existing language (see below).

**Translating guide:** Weblate support is planned. For now, go to the .arb file of the language you want to translate (for example, [app_de.arb](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_de.arb) file for German) and change the text inside the "" quotation marks. Use the [English](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/blob/master/assets/l10n/app_en.arb) translation as a reference for the text to be translated to the target language. If the keys listed in the [untranslatedMessages.txt](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/blob/master/untranslatedMessages.txt) don't exist, simply create them just like the others.

Send in your translated files as a [Pull request](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/pulls)

### Bug Reports, Feature Requests and Improvements

Open an issue on GitHub: [Open issue](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/issues). Remember to check for duplicates and try to give important information such as the app version, your operating system, etc.

### Code

Feel free to send in a [pull request](https://github.com/iakmds/buhocms/pulls)! To get started with Flutter, follow this link: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to the project's directory and run `flutter pub get` to get all necessary packages. To receive all localized strings, run `flutter gen-l10n`. To test the app, run the project in debug mode by selecting a device in your preferred Flutter IDE and running the app in debug mode
3. Build BuhoCMS (see steps for the different platforms below)

**Windows** executable: Run the following command in your terminal on a Windows machine: `flutter build windows` â€“ the output file will be generated at `buhocms\build\windows\runner\Release\buhocms.exe`.

**Linux** executable: Run the following command in your terminal: `flutter build linux` â€“ the output files, including the executable, will be generated at`buhocms/build/linux/x64/release/bundle`.
